## 📜 About The Project

A typing game.

## 🎨 Overview

Unholy Typing is a minimalistic falling words typing game where the player must type words that appear on the screen before they fall down. The visuals are inspired by the open source typing test [monkeytype.com][monkeytype-gh].

Some **key features** of Unholy Typing are:

- **Minimalistic design:** focused on simplicity and readability
- **Customization:** Several themes available
- **Accessibility:** Game difficulty changes based on the player's speed

## ⚙️ Technologies used

This game has been developed using the **Unity** engine, which uses **C#** as scripting language. Since Unholy Typing is basically a text-based game, it heavily relies on the **TextMeshPro** Unity library. 

## ⌨ Development

### 📅 Devlog

The [devlog](./devlog.md) is just a markdown file where I add screenshots and gifs about the development process

### 🐙 Git and Github

You can also follow the development of this game through the [issues][gh-issues] and [Github Projects kanban table][gh-projects].
I'm using the [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits] standard so the git log is clean and understandable.
